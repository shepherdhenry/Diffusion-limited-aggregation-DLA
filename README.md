# Diffusion-limited-aggregation-DLA
Simulating diffusion-limited aggregation based on python
## Abstract
In this report, we present a study of the Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) process using the Monte Carlo method in Python. Our simulation method is based on the classic algorithm proposed by Witten and Sender, and we extend it to consider various scenarios, including general cases, density function and fractal dimension analysis. Moreover, we investigate the effects of different parameters on the DLA process, such as introducing Psnn, varying probabilities on direction, real boundary, 3D DLA, and different seed configurations. To enhance the visualization of our simulation results, we create animations and produce beautiful DLA images. Our study provides valuable insights into the DLA process and demonstrates the versatility of our simulation method.
